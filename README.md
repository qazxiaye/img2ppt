This tool uses a batch of images as backgrounds of slides in a generated powerpoint.

The images should be in the working directory and in jpg format (can modify in source). There will be no blank margin in generated powerpoint.

The tool is based on project ['powerpoint'](https://github.com/pythonicrubyist/powerpoint). It cooperates well with [Smallpdf](https://smallpdf.com/cn/pdf-to-jpg), so that we can coordinate Latex with Powerpoint.
